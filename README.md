These are some of the questions I have solved during my stint at Competitive
Programming. I have uploaded the codes here along with the questionnaire. I
would like to thank the Competition organizers for regularly providing me and
all other aspirant programmers with wonderful questions to ponder into and help
improve our coding skills.

My intention behind this is that I would like to help those who would like to
get some hints as to how to solve some questions. Although, Editorials are
available, but I feel a sample code solution can help a lot of coders.

This is a part-time project and I would like to apologize for those who expect
solutions to a big number of solutions.
